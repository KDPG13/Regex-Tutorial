# Tutorial: Regex matching Hex value

Regular expressions are a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern for text. It is also defined as a string of text that allows you to create patterns to help with managing, matching, and locating text.


-Fun fact: regex come from the mathematical concept of regular sets.

## Summary

I will be discussing the parts of a regular expression that is used to match hex values. Any precise color can be accurately described to a computer using the hexadecimal scheme, ensuring consistency and accuracy in an electronic display. A six-digit number preceded by the # symbol defines a color that is utilized in a website or computer software. This code is known as a hexadecimal color value.  /^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/

## Regex Components

### Anchors

Regular expressions give specific significance to anchors. They don't fit any of the characters. Instead, they align with a character's location before or after another:
The ^ anchor lines up with the start of the text.
The dollar sign ($) anchor corresponds to the end of the text.
/<b>^<b>#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})<b>$<b>/
